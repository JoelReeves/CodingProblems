/*
 The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
 
 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
 
 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten 
 natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 
 Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
